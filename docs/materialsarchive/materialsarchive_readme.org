* Preliminary

Clone the GitHub repository:
#+begin_src bash
git clone git@github.com:HaoZeke/nebmmf_repro.git
#+end_src

* About
Contains the reproduction details for the publication on the performance and logs for the RONEB algorithm for seeking accelerated transition state.

** Reference
If you use this repository or its parts please cite the corresponding publication or data source.

*** TODO Preprint
#+begin_quote
#+end_quote

** TODO Replication data
Remember to inflate the data using the materialscloud source before using the scripts in the repository. This can be done by running the following--assuming that the ~.xz~ files are in ~data~ relative to the repository root:
#+begin_src bash
#+end_src

*** Reusing models
To reuse the models and predictions, both F.A.I.R. formatted results and easier to work with ~R~ formats are provided.
**** TODO From R
The record contains ~R~ objects for the ~brms~ models and their predictions. The model dependencies need to be loaded. After this, the base ~R~ function, ~readRDS~ will suffice:
#+begin_src R
library('brms')
model <- readRDS("data/models/brms_pes_cglbfgs_norot.rds")
#+end_src
More helper functions for generating and using these models and predictions are in the Github repository.
+The repository employs ~pixi~ for dependency management and organizes content by function:

| Directory       | Description                                                                    |
|-----------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ~case_studies/~ | Specific molecular systems and ~optbench~ configurations.                      |
| ~data/~         | Raw benchmarks (~.csv~), Stan models, and Parquet data.                        |
| ~docs/~         | Documentation, including ~.org~ files for visualization and model definitions. |
| ~eonRuns/~      | Workflow configurations and results for the eOn runs.                          |
| ~scripts/~      | Python utilities for generating YAML configs and parsing simulation outputs.   |

The results directory (~eonRuns/results~) implements the following hierarchy:
- **00_models**: Contains the PyTorch (~.pt~) Machine Learning Potentials used for the PES evaluations.
- **01_endpoints**: Atomic coordinates for the reactant and product states for each system (e.g., ~01_hcn~, ~09_parentdielsalder~).
- **02_idpp**: Initial guesses for the reaction paths.
- **03_neb**: Optimized transition state paths using the RONEB and standard NEB algorithms.
- **04_plots**: Resultant visualizations and energy profiles for each chemical system.

*** Configuration and Environment
This project uses ~pixi~ for reproducible environment management.
- ~pixi.toml~ / ~pixi.lock~: Define the environment.
- ~baker_systems.yml~ / ~birkholz_systems.yaml~: Define the chemical systems for the benchmarks.
- ~mutagen.yml~: Synchronization configuration for remote HPC execution.
